# ‚úÖ Split Coordinates - Now Visible!

## Problem
Split coordinates were not visible in the UI because segments had zero height (`h_pt: 0`), causing them to be skipped during rendering.

## Root Cause
The initial splitting logic tried to create synthetic start/end positions for each page/column segment, but didn't set proper Y coordinates. This resulted in start and end having the same Y position, leading to zero height bounding boxes.

## Solution
Implemented a smarter approach that creates proper synthetic markers with valid Y coordinates:

### For Multi-Page Elements:

**First Page Segment:**
- Start: Use real start position from aux file
- End: Create synthetic end at page bottom (Y=0)

**Middle Page Segments:**
- Start: Create synthetic start at page top (Y=pageHeight)
- End: Create synthetic end at page bottom (Y=0)

**Last Page Segment:**
- Start: Create synthetic start at page top
- End: Use real end position from aux file

This ensures all segments have proper vertical extent and are visible.

## Current Status

‚úÖ **All segmented items have valid heights**
‚úÖ **26 elements split into 64 bounding boxes**
‚úÖ **0 segmented items with zero height**
‚úÖ **Files updated in UI directory**

## Test Results

```
‚úÇÔ∏è  Split "sec-p-008" into 2 segments (pages: 2,3, cols: 0,0)
‚úÇÔ∏è  Split "sec-p-009" into 2 segments (pages: 2,3, cols: 0,0)
‚úÇÔ∏è  Split "sec-p-014" into 3 segments (pages: 3,4,5, cols: 0,0,0)
...

‚úÖ Generated 64 marked boxes from 36 elements
   üìä Split: 26 | Single: 10
```

## Sample Output

```json
{
  "id": "sec-p-008_seg1of2",
  "originalId": "sec-p-008",
  "page": 2,
  "segmentIndex": 0,
  "totalSegments": 2,
  "x_pt": 56.91,
  "y_pt": 652.18,
  "w_pt": 235.85,
  "h_pt": 192.86  ‚Üê Valid height!
}
```

## How to Use

1. **Regenerate coordinates** (if not done already):
   ```bash
   node scripts/external/sync_from_aux.js TeX/ENDEND10921-generated.aux --force
   ```

2. **Files are already copied** to `ui/` directory

3. **Reload the UI page** in your browser:
   - Open `http://localhost:3000/ui/`
   - Make sure the JSON file is loaded
   - You should now see all split coordinates!

4. **Verify**: Check browser console for:
   ```
   Drawing 64 overlays for page X using unit: pt
   Item sec-p-008_seg1of2: Final position - left: X, top: Y, width: W, height: H
   ```

## Known Limitation

**Column Splitting (Scenarios 1 & 3) Not Yet Implemented**

Currently, the system only splits by pages (Scenario 2), not by columns within a page. This is because:
- The `.aux` file only has one start/end marker per element total
- We don't have reliable information about where text wraps from left to right column
- Column splitting would require additional markup in the LaTeX source

**What works:**
- ‚úÖ Scenario 2: Page spanning (page 1 ‚Üí page 2) ‚Üí 2 items

**What needs more work:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Scenario 1: Column spanning (left ‚Üí right, same page)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Scenario 3: Column + page spanning

For now, elements that span columns on the same page will show as a single wide box across both columns.

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

To implement full column splitting:

1. **Add column markers to LaTeX:**
   - Detect column changes in TeX
   - Output markers in `.aux` file with column info

2. **Enhanced detection:**
   - Use actual column widths from TeX settings
   - Detect X-coordinate threshold more accurately

3. **Split within page:**
   - Create separate boxes for left/right column portions
   - Handle column boundaries properly

For most use cases, the current page-based splitting is sufficient and provides accurate overlays.
