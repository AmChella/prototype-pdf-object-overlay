# Bug Fix: Stage Completion Not Showing Green/Completed Status

## 🐛 Problem

The progress stages weren't turning green when completed. Stages would become active but never showed as completed (✅).

**Root Cause:** When transitioning from one stage to the next, the code only marked the immediately previous stage as completed, not ensuring ALL previous stages were properly marked.

---

## ✅ Solution

Added two new helper functions:

### 1. `activateStage(stageName)`
Activates a stage and automatically marks ALL previous stages as completed.

```javascript
activateStage('pdf'); 
// Result:
// - xml → completed ✅
// - tex → completed ✅
// - pdf → active 🔵
// - json → pending ⏳
```

### 2. `completeStagesUpTo(stageName)`
Marks all stages up to and including the specified stage as completed.

```javascript
completeStagesUpTo('json');
// Result:
// - xml → completed ✅
// - tex → completed ✅
// - pdf → completed ✅
// - json → completed ✅
```

## 📝 Changes Made

### Before (❌ Broken)

```javascript
// When moving to TeX stage
setProgressStage('xml', 'completed');
setProgressStage('tex', 'active');
// Problem: If TeX stage activated before XML was explicitly completed,
// XML would never show as completed
```

### After (✅ Fixed)

```javascript
// When moving to TeX stage
activateStage('tex');
// Automatically:
// 1. Marks XML as completed
// 2. Marks TeX as active
// Result: All previous stages guaranteed to be completed
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### activateStage() Logic

```javascript
function activateStage(stageName) {
    const stages = ['xml', 'tex', 'pdf', 'json'];
    const currentIndex = stages.indexOf(stageName);
    
    // Mark all previous stages as completed
    for (let i = 0; i < currentIndex; i++) {
        setProgressStage(stages[i], 'completed');
    }
    
    // Mark current stage as active
    setProgressStage(stageName, 'active');
}
```

**Example Flow:**
```
activateStage('pdf')
↓
currentIndex = 2 (pdf is at index 2)
↓
Loop: i = 0 → setProgressStage('xml', 'completed') ✅
Loop: i = 1 → setProgressStage('tex', 'completed') ✅
↓
setProgressStage('pdf', 'active') 🔵
```

### completeStagesUpTo() Logic

```javascript
function completeStagesUpTo(stageName) {
    const stages = ['xml', 'tex', 'pdf', 'json'];
    const targetIndex = stages.indexOf(stageName);
    
    // Mark all stages up to and including target as completed
    for (let i = 0; i <= targetIndex; i++) {
        setProgressStage(stages[i], 'completed');
    }
}
```

**Example Flow:**
```
completeStagesUpTo('json')
↓
targetIndex = 3 (json is at index 3)
↓
Loop: i = 0 → setProgressStage('xml', 'completed') ✅
Loop: i = 1 → setProgressStage('tex', 'completed') ✅
Loop: i = 2 → setProgressStage('pdf', 'completed') ✅
Loop: i = 3 → setProgressStage('json', 'completed') ✅
```

## 📊 Updated Message Handlers

### generation_progress & processing_progress

**Before:**
```javascript
if (message.includes('tex')) {
    setProgressStage('xml', 'completed');  // Explicit
    setProgressStage('tex', 'active');
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
if (message.includes('tex')) {
    activateStage('tex');  // Handles everything
}
```

### generation_complete & processing_complete

**Before:**
```javascript
setProgressStage('json', 'completed');  // Only marks last stage
```

**After:**
```javascript
completeStagesUpTo('json');  // Marks ALL stages
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Generate Document

```bash
1. Start server: node server/server.js
2. Open: http://localhost:3000/ui/
3. Click "Sample Document"
4. Watch progress:
   - Stage 1 (XML) → Active 🔵 → Completed ✅
   - Stage 2 (TeX) → Active 🔵 → Completed ✅
   - Stage 3 (PDF) → Active 🔵 → Completed ✅
   - Stage 4 (JSON) → Active 🔵 → Completed ✅
   - Progress bar → 0% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%
```

### Test 2: Apply Instruction

```bash
1. Load a document
2. Click any overlay
3. Select action
4. Click "Apply"
5. Watch all 4 stages complete with green checkmarks ✅
```

### Test 3: Console Verification

Open browser console and look for:
```
🎯 Activated stage: tex (completed 1 previous stages)
📊 Stage xml set to: completed
📊 Stage tex set to: active
```

## ✅ Results

### Before (❌)
```
[1] XML Changes            ⏳  ← Never turned green
[2] TeX Generation         ⏳  ← Active but previous not completed
[ ] PDF Compilation        ⏳
[ ] JSON Coordination      ⏳
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 0%
```

### After (✅)
```
[✓] XML Changes            ✅  ← Properly completed!
[●] TeX Generation         ⏳  ← Active
[ ] PDF Compilation        ⏳
[ ] JSON Coordination      ⏳
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 25%
```
